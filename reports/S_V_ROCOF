S_V_ROCOF
Out = South Australia at credible risk of separation from NEM, limit SA to VIC Heywood interconnection flow to prevent Rate of Change of Frequency exceeding 1 Hz/sec in SA immediately following separation. 

Limit:		ROC Frequency
Impact:		Vic - SA (Heywood) Interconnector
Reason:		Limit interconnection flow to minimise risk of cascading tripping of generation in SA post separation due to high RoCoF. Limit calculated based on online inertia in SA.
